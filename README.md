# Social_Crypto_DAO
My winning project on Eth-RIO. It aims gathering artists from marginalized communities in Rio de Janeiro and changemakers, not only providing more visibility to those artists but also easing that well intentioned changemakers contribute with improvements in social issue. We do this through a marketplace of NFTs and, posteriorly, as a DAO.
